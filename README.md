-481_SimpleGame
===============
The game I created is a take off of a classic memory game.
The game board has twenty grey buttons, each button is also
associated with one of ten unique colors (2 each). When a button is
clicked, the color is shown, when a second button is pressed, that
button's color is shown briefly before both returning to gray. If the buttons
both have the same color, they turn white and become unclickable. The
goal is to clear all buttons on the board by memorizing the locations of
the colors that have been seen.

I ran this game through eclipse on both an android virtual device and a real
android phone. To do so I imported the "Memory" file system into an eclipse workspace
and then ran the file "MainActivity.java" located under src/practice481
